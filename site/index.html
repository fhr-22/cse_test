<p>
    The Department of Meows Science & Engineering is relatively new compared to other academic
    departments of the University. This department was established in 1992. It started functioning in the
    Department of Physics, University of Kalyani, with only one course and that was Postgraduate Diploma in
    Computer Application (PGDCA) with student strength of fifteen. Subsequently, at the end of 2002, the
    Department started functioning in its new building. The two existing courses, Master in Computer
    Application (MCA) and Master of Technology in Computer Science (M.Tech.) were started from 2001 and 2003
    respectively.


</p>

<h2>Section</h2>
<p> The department currently has seven efficient faculty members and seven other staffs to run the courses
    smoothly. Healthy teacher-student relationship and well equipped laboratories have paved the way towards
    growth in the IT sector. The department recognizes the importance of Information Technology in the
    modern world and is dedicated towards making all possible efforts to place its students in the run.
